# Setting Up the Project

Once the project is downloaded onto your local system. You are good to go! The player contoller is pre-setup as a prefab, just grab the prefab and drag it onto the scene.

### Designing Levels
There is no ingame level designer, which means that you need to design the level yourself in the editor! But its easy! **First**, create a cube and name it `Environment` or anything you want. This `Environment` object will become the parent of the entire level. Inside this object, you caa add walls, floors, roofs or anything you want! **Secondally**, Creating specific areas can be done by creating different parents inside the parent named `Environment`, for example, `Room 2`

### Baking Ligths
There aren't any light probes in the project just yet! But no need, you'll need to bake the lights directly.

### UI
TMP is pre-downloaded into this project, meaning that you don't have to download it yourself! Which means that designing UI is better and easier! The main menu is already integrated into the project, with basic animation and UI design! These can be removed with ease!
